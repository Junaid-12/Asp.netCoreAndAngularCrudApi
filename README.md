# Asp.netCoreAndAngularCrudApi
 Asp.netCoreAndAngularCrudApi
 This project is a Web API built using ASP.NET Core that implements full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The API allows clients to interact with a backend database to perform operations on resources such as users, products, or other entitie
 Key Features:

Create: Enables the creation of new records in the database through POST requests.
Read: Provides GET endpoints to retrieve single or multiple records.
Update: Allows updating of existing records via PUT or PATCH requests.
Delete: Facilitates the deletion of records with DELETE requests.
Secure Access: Integrated authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure data transactions.
Error Handling: Includes comprehensive error handling to manage and return meaningful HTTP status codes and messages.
Technologies Used:

ASP.NET Core Web API
Entity Framework Core
SQL Server for database management
Swagger for API documentation
Dependency Injection for better code modularity

# Angular For Consume the RestFul Api 
This Angular application is designed to interact with a RESTful Web API for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The front-end application communicates with the back-end API, enabling users to manage data through a user-friendly interface.
Key Features:

Create: Users can add new records using forms, with data sent to the API via HTTP POST requests.
Read: The application retrieves and displays data from the API using HTTP GET requests, with data displayed in lists, tables, or detailed views.
Update: Users can modify existing records, with changes submitted to the API via HTTP PUT or PATCH requests.
Delete: Records can be deleted directly from the interface, with corresponding DELETE requests sent to the API.
Real-Time Data Updates: The application reflects changes immediately after operations, providing a responsive user experience.
Form Validation: Angularâ€™s reactive forms and validation features ensure that only valid data is submitted to the API.
Routing: Implemented Angular Router to navigate between different views, such as listing, editing, and creating records.
Service Layer: The application uses Angular services to encapsulate HTTP requests, keeping the component code clean and maintainable.
Technologies Used:

Angular Framework
TypeScript for strong typing and advanced features
Angular HTTPClient for making API requests
Angular Material for responsive and modern UI components
RxJS for handling asynchronous operations and managing state
Angular Router for navigation between different views
